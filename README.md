# Needleman Wunsch Traceback
 Needleman Wunch Traceback using java
This program uses the needleman wunch algorithm to find similarities between strings and rebuilds them while aligning the similarities. 
It uses a 2D array to assign alignment scores as the strings are checked then traces back through the alignemnt scores until it rebuilds the string with the similarities aligned.

This was a class project where we were given instruction on the basic premise but was left to figure out for ourselves.
